 # KEEP UNTIL TRANSFER
 Q for Steve:
1) What challenges will I run into due to the relative lack of "switchers"? [Don't worry about this. You can analyze the switchers by group, and/or aggregate them.]
2) Do I need the weights? [Nope]
3) Can I use the 'who you voted for in 2008' q (asked in 2010)? [Yes]

Also, Steve says consult Key's The Responsible Electorate, and comparing waves to the cross sections
